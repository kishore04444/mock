============================================

1. EXTRACT THE FOLDER
   - If you received mockinter.zip, right-click → Extract All (Windows)
     or double-click to extract (Mac).
   - Open the EXTRACTED FOLDER (the one containing "client", "server", package.json).
   - Do NOT open the .zip file in an editor.

2. INSTALL NODE.JS (if not installed)
   - Download from https://nodejs.org (LTS version).
   - Install with default options.

3. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
   - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell (or Terminal on Mac).
   - Go to the project folder, e.g.:
     cd path\to\mockinter
   - Run:
     npm run install:all
   - Wait until it finishes (no errors).

4. START THE APP
   - In the same folder, run:
     npm run dev
   - You should see "Server running" and "Local: http://localhost:5173".

5. OPEN IN BROWSER
   - Go to: http://localhost:5173
   - Sign up with any name, email, and password.
   - Use the app (Dashboard, Resume, Interview, Profile).

6. STOP THE APP
   - In the terminal, press Ctrl+C.

No MongoDB or OpenAI key needed. Data is saved in memory (resets when you stop the server).
